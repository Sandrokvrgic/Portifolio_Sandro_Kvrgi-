Included in this repository are two comprehensive reports, each accompanied by their respective codes and datasets. Below, you'll find concise descriptions of the assigned tasks for each report, along with insights into the tools and techniques employed throughout the studies.

Data Mining

Task:
Collaborating in pairs, our challenge involved constructing a data mining report to demonstrate the skills acquired during the course. Our assignment was to source or create a unique dataset, subsequently applying two or more machine learning algorithms. The primary objective was to conduct a thorough comparison of these algorithms, showcasing our analytical prowess and understanding of their applications.

Tools & Tehniques:
Programming language - Python
Libraries - pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, sklearn, mpl_toolkits
Tehniques - dataset merging, attribute elimination, scaling, standardization, plotting, correlation analysis, linear regression, support vector machines with radial kernel, and various evaluation methods.

Four in a row

Task:
We were presented with a programmed game known as "Four in a Row," and our challenge was to implement a Minimax algorithm on it. The goal was to create an intelligent computer player that would be unbeatable by human opponents. This task demanded the application of advanced artificial intelligence techniques. By incorporating the Minimax algorithm, we aimed to elevate the computer player's strategic decision-making, ensuring a formidable and challenging adversary for human players. The end of the task was to compare the performance between normal Minimax algorithm and Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning.

Tools & Tehniques:
Programming language - Java
Tehniques - Minimax algorithm, Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning
